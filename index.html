  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
    While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
    Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions.
    In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from the camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians.
    The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction.
    The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle.
